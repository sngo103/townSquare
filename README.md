### OUR APP INFO
- **Theme:** Create a Passion Project - Make something you've always wanted to build!
- **Track:** Education
- **App Name:** Town Square

For our project, we decided to create a virtual bulletin board app for our college. We were inspired by the many layers of posters hanging on walls and bulletins across campus, making it difficult to find events that interest us. Our app is intended to be a student's pocket guide to current events going on at school at any given time and a tracker for events that they are interested in. Currently, our app allows users to create accounts, view current events, and create their own events. We used the MERN Stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, to build our app. In the future, we hope to implement more features such as event tags, organizations, and social media integration.

*This project was created in order to participate in the Winter 2019 Hunter College Codefest, sponsored by Google.If you'd like to learn more about our project, join us, or want to share comments/suggestions, please reach out to us through Github, LinkedIn, or Facebook.
